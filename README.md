# Contour-Designs-Section-Replace
This code was used on a site with a few issues. It was created to be usable on multiple product pages that have similar content but also similar difficulties. There are duplicate sections on the pages. The classes and IDs used in the markup do not help to identify what each section contains. So, the scripts are meant to do the following, regardless of which product page on which it runs:

- Find the sections that need new treatment
- Remove any duplicated sections
- Introduce new DOM content in place of the questionable content

This is a test that runs after DOM load.
